# AI Decision & Prediction System 🚀

## 📌 Description
The **AI Decision & Prediction System** is a web-based tool that analyzes user-inputted situations and provides probability-based solutions. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, it identifies key terms, assigns probability scores, and predicts potential outcomes.

This project helps users make **smarter, data-driven decisions** by evaluating risks and opportunities in various scenarios like **business, investments, career, health, and relationships**.

## 🔹 Features
✅ **AI-Powered NLP Analysis** – Extracts keywords and assigns probability scores.  
✅ **Probability-Based Decision Making** – Provides a risk assessment and success likelihood.  
✅ **Simple & User-Friendly Interface** – Easy-to-use with instant results.  
✅ **Frontend-Only (No Backend Required)** – Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ Enter a **situation or problem** in the input box.  
2️⃣ Click **"Analyze"** to process the input.  
3️⃣ The system extracts relevant **keywords** and **calculates a probability score**.  
4️⃣ Displays an **outcome prediction** based on the analysis.
